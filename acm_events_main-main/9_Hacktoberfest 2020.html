      <h1>Hacktoberfest 2020</h1>
      <p class="text">
        The first session of the OPEN SOURCE SERIES on Introduction to Open Source and Hacktoberfest was organized by ACM IGDTUW along with Lean In@IGDTWU. The speaker was none other than Soumya Sharma, an alumnus of IGDTUW who was a part of Microsoft Engage 2020 and has significantly contributed to various projects. The session was informative and it gave an insight into Hacktober fest. The curious minds had their interactions with the speaker. Their enthusiasm made the session fun and hands down success.

        at 6 pm to gear-up students for placement season and not let the lockdown imposed, due to
        COVID-19, affect them. The keynote speakers were Ms Divya Chakarwarti and Ms Shefali Jindal.
        Ms Shefali and Ms Divya are alumni of IGDTUW and were also ACM ICPC programming contest finalists.
        Massive number of students had registered for the session. Important interview round questions for
        companies and valuable competitive coding hacks were intensively discussed in the session.
        The session was a big hit !

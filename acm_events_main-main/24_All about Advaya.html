      <h1>All about Advaya</h1>
      <p class="text">
        Advaya is the week-long annual technical fest, and the heart of ACM IGDTUW events.
        We conduct seminars delivering hands-on experience on trending domains along with
        many other exciting events like scavenger hunts, coding contests, open-source challenges,
        daily trivia etc. Advaya is anticipated so much that even when the lockdown hit the year of 2020,
        events conducted under Advaya ran smoothly with attendees brimming up the webinars.
        The year 2020 also witnessed a large number of students from diverse universities like Vel Tec,
        Silicon Institute of Technology etc. participating in Advaya-Hacks.

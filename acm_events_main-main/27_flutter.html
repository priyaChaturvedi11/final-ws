      <p class="text">
        Flutter Chandigarh and ACM - IGDTUW conducted an exciting event where students got hands-on experience
        and explored the amazing possibilities that they could achieve on integrating machine learning with your
        flutter apps, with ML kit and Tensorflow. The event was conducted live on youtube. It was an opportunity
        to all those who were new to Machine Learning. The ML model was conducted from scratch, and the students
        were provided with answers to all their questions, via the live chat.
